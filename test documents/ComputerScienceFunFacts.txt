10 Fun Facts About Computer Science

1. The first computer "bug" was an actual insect! In 1947, engineers found that the Harvard Mark II computer was malfunctioning because a moth got stuck in a relay. They removed it and taped it into the logbook, calling it the "first actual case of a bug being found."

2. The term "byte" was coined in 1956 by Werner Buchholz while working on the IBM 7030 Stretch computer. It was chosen to represent a group of bits, typically 8, and was a play on the word "bite" to avoid confusion with "bit."

3. The first computer mouse was made of wood! Invented in 1964 by Douglas Engelbart, it was a wooden box with two wheels and a button, used to navigate a graphical user interface.

4. The first website ever created is still online! Launched on August 6, 1991, by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, it explained the World Wide Web. You can still visit it at its original URL.

5. The shortest war in history lasted 38 minutes, but the shortest computer virus, called "Slammer," spread worldwide in 10 minutes in 2003, infecting 75,000 servers and causing massive internet disruptions.

6. The original Macintosh had 128 KB of RAM, less than what's needed to load a single modern webpage. For comparison, a typical smartphone today has over 4 GB of RAMâ€”over 30,000 times more!

7. The first "Turing-complete" computer, the Z3, was built in 1941 by Konrad Zuse in Germany. It could theoretically perform any computation, making it a precursor to modern computers.

8. The programming language Python was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, not the snake. Guido van Rossum, its creator, was a fan of the comedy troupe and wanted a fun, memorable name.

9. The first video game, "Spacewar!", was created in 1962 on a PDP-1 computer. It took 200 hours to develop and featured two spaceships battling in space, laying the groundwork for modern gaming.

10. The concept of "CAPTCHA" (those "I'm not a robot" tests) was invented to help digitize books. Early CAPTCHAs asked users to type distorted text to verify they weren't bots, while also helping transcribe scanned books for projects like Google Books.
